# Tezos Blockchain Protocol Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of different protocols of the Tezos blockchain using Power BI and SQL queries.

## Overview

Blockchain protocols are the backbone of any blockchain network, dictating how transactions are validated, blocks are formed, and consensus is reached. Understanding and analyzing these protocols is crucial for developers, researchers, and stakeholders to assess the efficiency, security, and scalability of a blockchain network.

## Contents

1. **Data**: The `Tezos_Protocol_Analysis.pbip` file contains a comprehensive report generated using Power BI. This report visualizes various metrics and insights derived from the analysis of Tezos blockchain protocols.

2. **pbi**: The `Query_BQ` directory includes SQL queries used to extract data from Tezos blockchain datasets. These queries are designed to gather relevant information for protocol analysis.

## Usage

### Power BI Report
